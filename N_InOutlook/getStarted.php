    "ProcessMaker in Outlook" is a plugin created to allow standard ProcessMaker users to use ProcessMaker Open Source BPM & Workflow from within the Microsoft Outlook email client (2007 and 2010) instead of through the standard browser interface.

    This plugin allows users to perform all common tasks from within the Outlook interface including the following:
<br />
<ol>
	<li>Start a New Case                                  </li>
	<li>Review and attend to existing Cases in the Inbox  </li>
	<li>Save Drafts                                       </li>
	<li>Review Participated, Paused, and Unassigned Cases </li>
	<!-- <li>Review attached documents in DMS tree             </li>
	<li>Perform Process Supervisor functions              </li>
	<li>Search                                            </li> -->
</ol>	
All tasks are performed in the same way they are performed through the web browser.  Designers and Administrators should still enter via a web browser to perform their respective tasks.
<!-- <br /><br />
There is an additional new feature which has been added to this plugin which is not available in ProcessMaker via a web browser.  In the Outlook integration a case can be started based on an email that is received in a specific Outlook folder.  When this feature is configured, the ProcessMaker outlook plugin will poll received cases and then extract relevant data (from, subject, body, etc.).  ProcessMaker will then create a case and pass this extracted data into ProcessMaker variables as pertinent metadata.   To see more details click on the folder "Inbox/ProcessMaker/Autopilot". -->

    The plugin creates a new command bar in Outlook with one option: "Configuration".  The Configuration option allows the user to change the data connection to the server where ProcessMaker is installed.  This is the same screen that must be configured when the plugin is initially installed.
<!-- <br /><br />
The Autopilot option is used to configure the Autopilot functionality.  For more details about this feature click on the folder "Inbox/ProcessMaker/Autopilot". -->
